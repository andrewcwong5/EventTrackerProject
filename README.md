# EventTrackerProject
## Overview
This project keeps track of meals consumed by a user. It records the name of the meal of the day(breakfast, lunch, etc.), what foods were eaten, the total calories, and the cost of the food. This is the backend database with CRUD functionality using Spring Rest. It can be used as part of a diet or budget app.

##Technologies/Topics Applied
RESTful web service allows a client to retrieve and manage resources stored on a server by using JPA Repository and Service classes instead of DAOs.

Spring JPA

Postman to test RESTful APIs

##Lessons Learned
Packages root need to be named the same in the boot and JPA folders.

remember to change to JSON instead to text in Postman otherwise you get input error.

Really important to have the right build.gradle, settings.gradle and applications.properties otherwise you'll just keep copy pasting the broken code throughout each new project.
